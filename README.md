LTspice files for video: https://youtu.be/RemtlUqbdw8

Extract files to the root directory of your data disk (e.g. d:/)

Open LTspice and go to Tools --> Control Panel --> Sym & Lib. Search Paths

Enter "D:\Solar-Panels" in both fields and save. Now you can open "StringOfPanels.asc" in LTspice and run the simulation.

Click into the plot area and go to Plot Settings --> Open Plot Settings File. Select the "D:\Solar-Panels" directory and select the Solar-Panels-Power.plt file. Now you should see the traces

Please reset the paths to the default values after you are finished with this video.

You can copy the library and symbols files to your library folder if you want to reuse it with other projects. Then you have to adapt the file  names, of course.
